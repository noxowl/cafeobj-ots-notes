# cafeobj-ots-notes


This repository contains personal notes and practice files for modeling and verifying **Observational Transition Systems (OTS)** using **CafeOBJ**.

## Introduction

The main goal of this repository is to practice modeling simple systems as OTS in CafeOBJ, and to develop skills for writing **Proof Scores** to verify system invariants.

It is intended as a learning log to build a strong foundation for formal specification and verification workflows using CafeOBJ.

## Goals

- Practice the full OTS modeling cycle: defining hidden sorts, observers, actions, and invariants
- Build correct and readable Proof Scores for each modeled system
- Understand how to debug and refine specifications when Proof Scores fail
